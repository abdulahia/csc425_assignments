question 2: total is 7960 and  6162 megabytes are free. yes. 

question 4: I run the free command right before running and 687516 of memory was
being used. I run free right after and it creased to 690352. After I killed 
the program it came back to 687316. If the we increase the amount of memory
usage in my program then it also the memoery that was being used increased.

question 5: using man looked through some of the arguments and commads that
could be used with pmap.

question 6: in program I wrote print statement to get PID. Thus, called the 
-q flag with pmap and my PID. for exaampl, pmap -q 202141.    

question 7: I used pmap -x 202141 and I got the list of adresses as well as
some of the mappings that happend. It showed that memory-user program. It
also displays the total memory usage. We also see unrelated memory files within.

question 8: The similar effect can be seen in pmap when we increase heap
 allocation in memory-user.
